# Using the GOAT Network Bridge

The GOAT Network Bridge enables secure asset transfers between Bitcoin (L1) and GOAT Network (L2) through ZKM's Trustless Bridge Protocol. This guide will walk you through the bridging process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before bridging assets, ensure you have:
- A Bitcoin wallet with BTC and your Bitcoin receiving address
- A Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) configured for GOAT Network with your GOAT address
- Sufficient BTC for gas fees
- Connected to the correct network (Testnet: Chain ID 48816)

## Bridge Interface

Access the official GOAT Network bridge at:
- Testnet 3: [bridge.testnet3.goat.network](https://bridge.testnet3.goat.network)
- Mainnet: [bridge.goat.network](https://bridge.goat.network)

## Bridging Process

### Bitcoin to GOAT Network (L1 → L2)

<Steps>
### Connect Wallets
- Connect your Bitcoin wallet and provide your Bitcoin address
- Connect your Web3 wallet to GOAT Network and verify your GOAT address
- Verify you're on the correct network

### Initiate Bridge Transfer
- Select Bitcoin network and BTC asset on the bridge interface
- Enter the amount of BTC to bridge
- Confirm both your Bitcoin and GOAT addresses
- Review the transaction details and fees

### Confirm Transaction
- Sign the Bitcoin transaction in your wallet
- Wait for Bitcoin network confirmations (typically 2-3 blocks)
- Keep the bridge interface open during this process

### Receive Bridged Assets
- Once confirmed, BTC will appear in your GOAT wallet
- Verification typically completes within 10-15 minutes
</Steps>

### GOAT Network to Bitcoin (L2 → L1)

<Steps>
### Connect Wallet
- Connect your Web3 wallet to GOAT Network
- Ensure sufficient BTC balance and gas fees
- Verify your Bitcoin receiving address

### Initiate Withdrawal
- Select GOAT Network and BTC asset on the bridge interface
- Enter withdrawal amount
- Double-check your Bitcoin receiving address
- Confirm your GOAT Network address

### Confirm GOAT Transaction
- Approve the transaction in your Web3 wallet
- Wait for transaction confirmation on GOAT Network

### Complete Withdrawal
- Wait for the verification period
- BTC will be sent to your provided Bitcoin address

## Security Model

The bridge security is maintained through multiple layers:

### Trust-Minimized Design
- **State Liveness and Safety**: Ensures assets can be moved within finite time while preventing unauthorized access
- **n-of-n Multisig**: Uses native Bitcoin Multisig scripts for enhanced security
- **Permissionless Participation**: Allows any Bitcoin holder to participate as a validator

### Cryptographic Security
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- Multi-party computation for consensus
- Threshold signatures for validation
- Hash-based commitment schemes

### Challenge Protocol
- Any participant can challenge invalid transactions
- Economic incentives for honest behavior
- Automatic dispute resolution through GOAT-OCP
